# Karpiu

**Karpiu** is a package designed for marketing mix modeling by calling [Orbit](https://github.com/uber/orbit) from the backend. Karpiu is nothing more than a funny term invented by my daugther while she just reached her terrible two. I dedicated this term to the package as I heard so many times while making all the early development.
