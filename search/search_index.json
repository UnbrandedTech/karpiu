It aims to reduce human bias by means of ridge regression and evolutionary algorithms, enables actionable decision making providing a budget allocator and diminishing returns curves and allows ground-truth calibration to account for causation. lightweight_mmm - LMMM is a python library that helps organisations understand and optimise marketing spend across media channels.
